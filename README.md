# Covid-19 Greece

### **This is a visual representation of the pandemic in Greece.**<br/>
Data have been hardcoded on the script and they are available on the daily covid-19 records,<br/>
shared by Hellenic National Public Health Organization [(EODY)](https://eody.gov.gr/) and they can be found [here](https://eody.gov.gr/epidimiologika-statistika-dedomena/ektheseis-covid-19/).

Data are saved into lists starting from 1st November till 20 December, while the User has the option<br/> 
to adjust their starting point **(the "from" part)**.

User also has the option to "utilize" an adjustment regarding the weekends *(Saturday and Sunday)* in<br/>
order to get a finer percentage graph since percentages do NOT seem to be able to generalize for the<br/> 
whole population, due to the fact that Tests drop significantly at the weekends. 

:heavy_check_mark: adjustment = 
```diff 
+ True 
```

```diff
+ this text is highlighted in green
- this text is highlighted in red
